Instead of encoding all data in one proto, we will instead preface the proto
with a header field containing the number of total bytes in the proto. This will
be a configurable value that will be computed where the biggest possible Data
division below the maximum threshold is used. This will allow for easy chunking
when reading in messages etc.
