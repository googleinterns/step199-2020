# Stellarpoint

The StellarPoint Project aims to build a Pose 3D viewer
which will be beneficial to the Geoâ€™s Pose, 3D, and VPS teams.
Specifically, GeoPose relies on a 2D visualizer as their
former 3D viewer has fallen out of use and is now deprecated.
Therefore, we hope to create a product that can efficiently
and accurately display Pose data that is visually appealing
and user interactive. This viewer should allow the Geo Pose
team to debug and easily visualize pose data, making this
project universally beneficial and truly impactful.
