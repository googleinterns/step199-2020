# Stellarpoint

The Stellarpoint Project aims to build a Pose 3D viewer
which will be beneficial to the Geoâ€™s Pose, 3D, and VPS teams.
We hope to create a product that can efficiently and accurately
display Pose data that is visually appealing and user interactive.
This viewer should allow the Geo Pose team to debug and easily
visualize pose data, making this project universally beneficial
and truly impactful. The name 'Stellarpoint' is in reference to
the massive point clouds we show complementing the pose data.
These point clouds are made up of hundreds of thousands of points,
reconstructing any physical object in 3D space. The project uses
Three.js, an open source library which supports 3D web-applications.
This allows the user to easily upload pose or lidar data and quickly
see results in their web browser.
